# What is this repo about?

This is a boilerplate repository for testing and experimenting with TypeScript as I study it. I will be studying it using two books, as well as the documentation. 

Some examples will be shared here as a way to track my progress and play with its type system with simple practical examples... 

The books used for this will be:

[Programming TypeScript: Making Your JavaScript Applications Scale by Boris Cherny](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45362865-programming-typescript)

As well as the official Docs:

[TypeScript for JavaScript Programmers](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html)
